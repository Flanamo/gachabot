# gachabot
peek into the mind of a lunatic who doesn't know what he's doing<br><br>


<h1>if you read this ur gay lol</h1>
i made this to roll the gacha for mugen<br>

still got a lot to do.<br><br>


to do list:<br>
add weather dopant<br>
add sirou<br>
remove the url out of characters.json and just add it to the command instead so you only have to type "noel.gif"<br>
add admin perms so that people can't use reload, because I'm fucking stupid. thank god i didnt add any admin commands yet.<br>
add the ability to store someone's pick into a json (fuck databases)<br>
